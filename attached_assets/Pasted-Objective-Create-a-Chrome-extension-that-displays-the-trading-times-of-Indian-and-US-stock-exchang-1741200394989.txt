Objective:
Create a Chrome extension that displays the trading times of Indian and US stock exchanges, provides a reminder system with customization options, and includes a futuristic and minimalistic UI design. The extension should have a popup window, an options page, and beautiful animations for reminders.

Features and Requirements:
1. Extension Icon Behavior
If the Indian stock market is open:
Show a green dot at the top of the extension icon.
Display the current time in the format: "15:00 IST".
If the US stock market is open:
Show the current time in the format: "10:00 UST".
If both markets are closed:
Show only the default extension icon without any text or dots.
2. Popup Window
Header Section:
Add a horizontal menu at the top with two tabs: "Reminders" and "Markets".
Use smooth sliding animations when switching between tabs.
Reminders Tab:
Display a list of user-added reminders with their respective times.
Include a button to add new reminders.
Each reminder should have:
A toggle for recurring reminders (daily/weekly).
A small dropdown button for early reminders with options: 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins (default: 5 mins). Clicking the button toggles through these options.
Markets Tab:
Allow users to select which stock markets they want to track (India, USA, Japan).
Provide an option to set how many minutes before the market closes they want to be reminded.
Include a toggle for receiving reminders when the market opens.
Theme Toggle Button:
Add a button to toggle between light and dark themes.
Footer Section:
Add a small "Developed by [Your Name]" text with a Reddit icon linking to your Reddit profile.
3. Reminder Notifications
When a reminder triggers, display a small, animated pop-up notification.
The notification should disappear automatically after a few seconds.
Use smooth animations and visually appealing designs for the pop-up.
4. Options Page
Create a separate options page where users can customize:
Notification styles (e.g., colors, duration).
Default reminder settings (e.g., early reminder time).
Preferred stock markets to track.
Ensure the options page has a clean and intuitive layout.
5. Code Structure
Organize the project into separate files for better modularity:
background.js: Handle background tasks like checking market timings and triggering reminders.
popup.js: Manage the popup window's functionality.
options.js: Handle the options page logic.
styles.css: Define the extension's styling, including themes and animations.
notifications.js: Manage reminder notifications.
utils.js: Include helper functions for time calculations, market status checks, etc.
Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.
6. UI Design
Use a futuristic and minimalistic design:
Rounded corners for buttons and cards.
Smooth gradients and soft shadows for depth.
Consistent color schemes for light and dark themes.
Ensure the UI is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
